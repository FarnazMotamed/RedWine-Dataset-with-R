My favorite quote:
"If you are looking for a career where your services will be in high demand, you should find something where you provide a scarce, complementary service to something that is getting ubiquitous and cheap. So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap? Data. And what is complementary to data? Analysis"
— Hal Varian, UC Berkeley, Chief Economist at Google

“Anyone who tries to make you believe that he knows all about wines is obviously a fake.”
― Leon Adams, The Commonsense Book of Wine

“I cook with wine, sometimes I even add it to the food.”
― W.C. Fields, circa 1930’s

“One should always be drunk. That’s all that matters…But with what? With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you chose. But get drunk.”
― Charles Baudelaire, circa 1850s
